# Network Basics (Network)

>[!Note]- What is an IP Address?
> <!-- Multiline -->
> * **~={green}IP Address=~**: Unique 32-bit identifier for each device on a network. 
> 
> ![[Drawing 2025-02-08 15.44.44.excalidraw | center | 400]]

>[!Note]- What is a Packet?
> <!-- Multiline -->
> * **~={green}Packet=~**: A small unit of data transmitted over a network, containing a header (source/destination IP, metadata) and payload (actual data).
> * **~={green}Switches=~**: A network hardware device that directs packets to their destination.
> * **~={green}Link=~**: **~={blue}Physical=~** = fibre optic cables. **~={blue}Logical=~** = VPN tunnels. The "wiring" between switches that allow packets to be sent to it's destination.

>[!Note]- What is a Port?
> <!-- Multiline -->
> * **~={green}Port=~**: A **port** is a **numerical identifier (0-65535)** that allows multiple applications to communicate over the same IP address by directing network traffic to the correct service.
> 	* **~={red}Example=~**: IP Address: Port Number

# TCP and UDP (Transport)

>[!Note]- TCP
> <!-- Multiline -->
> **~={blue}What is TCP=~**
> * TCP establishes a virtual bidirectional connection between one host and another. This gives the illusion of not having to go through a network of links and switches.
> * **~={green}Pros=~**: Is reliable and guarantees packet delivery and correctness
> * **~={red}Cons=~**: Higher latency in setting up 3 way handshake

> ![[Drawing 2025-02-08 16.45.29.excalidraw | center | 550]]
> * **~={green}Acknowledgement Flag/Packet=~**: When you send a packet across a link, if it is received, an incremented ACK packet is sent back in response.
> 	* **~={purple}If Packet Received by Receiver=~**: The receiver **sends back a new small TCP packet with the ACK number incremented**, which represents what sequence number packet to send next (i.e. if we're on sequence number 100, it'll ask to send 101).
> 	* **~={purple}If Packet Lost or Corrupted=~**: If the acknowledgement packet was not sent by the recipient and the timer on the sender's side has lapped, then the sender will resend the last unacknowledged packet.
> * **~={green}Sequence Number=~**: Orders packets correctly at the receiver's end to reconstruct the original data
> * **~={green}Checksum=~**: Kinda like a hash. When you send a packet with the data + check sum, you compute the checksum of the data, and compare with the original checksum to check if corrupted.
> * ~={red}Buffer=~: Temp stores data before sending or processing. If packets are received out of order, they can be temporarily stored here. The host and switches contain these buffers.
> * **~={red}Timer=~**: How long as the host (sender) or switch do you wait to receive an acknowledgement packet.
> 
> **~={blue}3 Way Handshake=~**
> * Before communication begins between 2 hosts, a 3 way handshake must be performed
> * **~={purple}Send=~**: We send a packet with SEQ = X.
> 	* If we send just a SYN, the SEQ increments by 1 (since SYN “consumes” one sequence number)
> 	* If we send data, the SEQ increments by the number of bytes sent in that packet.
> 	* Otherwise it doesn't get incremented.
> * **~={purple}Return=~**: The ACK number is always the next expected SEQ number from the sender.

>[!Note]- UDP
> <!-- Multiline -->
> **~={blue}What is UDP=~**
> * UDP (User Datagram Protocol) is a connectionless transport protocol that sends data as independent packets (datagrams) without establishing a dedicated connection. It does not guarantee delivery, ordering, or error correction, making it faster and more lightweight than TCP
> * **~={green}Pros=~**: Low latency, no handshake required, useful for real-time applications like video streaming and gaming.
> * **~={red}Cons=~**: No built-in reliability, packets may be lost, duplicated, or arrive out of order.
> 
> **~={blue}UDP Packet=~**
> * **~={green}Checksum=~**: It does check for corruption

# DNS (Application)

>[!Note]- DNS
> <!-- Multiline -->
> ![[Pasted image 20250208211209.png]]

# HTTP (Application)

>[!Note]- HTTP
> <!-- Multiline -->
> **~={blue}What is HTTP?=~**
> * It is a request response protocol built on top of TCP
> 	* **~={green}Request=~**: We make a request to the server to run some code remotely as if we are running it locally
> 	* **~={green}Response=~**: The server runs that code and makes a response
> * **~={red}TLS=~** can be applied on top of HTTP to encrypt communication, creating **~={red}HTTPS=~**.

# Web Sockets (Application)

>[!Note]- Web Sockets
> <!-- Multiline -->
> **~={blue}What is WebSocket?=~**
>* A protocol different from HTTP, designed for real-time communication. Establishes a **~={green}persistent=~**, **~={green}bi-directional=~** connection, eliminating the need for polling.
>* **~={green}Pros=~**: No need to create a new request for each message. More efficient then HTTP polling, which requires TCP handshakes.
>* **~={red}Cons=~**:
>
>**~={blue}How to Setup WebSocket=~**
>1. **~={purple}WebSocket Handshake=~**: Initiate an HTTP request with `Upgrade: websocket` to switch to the WebSocket protocol.
>2. **~={purple}Open Connection=~**: The server responds with `101 Switching Protocols`, confirming the upgrade.
>3. **~={purple}Send & Receive Messages=~**: Use the WebSocket API to exchange data asynchronously.
>4. **~={purple}Close the Connection=~**: Either side can send a `close` frame to terminate the session gracefully.
